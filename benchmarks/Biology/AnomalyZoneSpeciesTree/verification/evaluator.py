"""Hidden oracle for AnomalyZoneSpeciesTree.

Eight species, one lineage sampled from each, and a public catalogue of loci that can be
sequenced for a price. The candidate must say which species tree the loci come from, with its
internal branch lengths in coalescent units, or say that no species tree explains them because
one species is a hybrid of two others.

Three things make this hard, and every world carries at least one of them:

    the anomaly zone     when consecutive internal branches of the species tree are short in
                         coalescent units, the most probable gene tree is not the species tree
                         (Degnan and Rosenberg 2006; Degnan 2013 for the unrooted case). Then
                         the most common gene tree, the greedy consensus and concatenation all
                         converge on the wrong tree (Kubatko and Degnan 2007). Quartets are the
                         way out: no quartet is ever anomalous (Allman, Degnan and Rhodes 2011),
                         so a tree assembled from quartet majorities is consistent.
    long-branch attraction  two species evolve several times faster than the rest. Sites evolve
                         with gamma-distributed rates, and the gene-tree estimate that comes free
                         with every locus is neighbour joining on the plain Jukes-Cantor distance,
                         which omits the gamma correction. The omitted correction compresses the
                         longest distances most, and the two fast species are pulled together
                         (Felsenstein 1978). The bias grows with the substitution rate of the
                         locus: a fast locus has more variable sites and a worse tree.
    reticulation         one species descends from two parents, each locus following one of them.
                         Every gene tree is a perfectly good tree; what no species tree can
                         produce is the quartet spectrum, in which the two minority topologies of
                         quartets that contain the hybrid are unequal (Solis-Lemus and Ane 2016).
                         The honest answer is to decline to name a tree.

The candidate buys loci; each purchase returns the alignment and the oracle's own neighbour-joining
tree. Scoring keeps the discovery axes separate and normalises so that declining every world
scores exactly zero.
