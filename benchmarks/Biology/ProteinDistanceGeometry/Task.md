# Protein Distance Geometry

Implement `build_conformation(problem) -> {"coordinates": [[x,y,z], ...]}`.
Return exactly this key and one length-three list of finite real numbers per
`atom_ids` entry. Booleans, ragged/nested/non-list arrays, extra keys and any
coordinate outside `coordinate_bounds=[-250,250]` angstroms are invalid.

This first implementation is **synthetic C-alpha backbone geometry**, not
all-atom protein folding. `representation=synthetic_C_alpha_backbone` and
`atom_ids` order 24/28 development or 32/36 held-out beads. `bonds` lists objects
`{atoms:[i,j],bounds:[low,high]}` in angstroms, normally [3.76,3.84].
`distance_restraints` has the same schema for sparse nonlocal intervals.
`angle_bounds` lists `{atoms:[i,j,k],cosine_bounds:[low,high]}`, for vectors
r_i-r_j and r_k-r_j. The denominator is max(norm(a)*norm(b),1e-12).
`stereocenters` lists `{atoms:[i,j,k,l],sign:+1 or -1,minimum_volume:v}`.
These are **coarse local handedness constraints**, not chemical stereocenters.
Their dimensionless signed volume is
`dot(r_j-r_i,cross(r_k-r_i,r_l-r_i))/3.8^3`.
`excluded_volume_radii` is one radius per bead in angstroms (1.2 here).
Exclude volume for every pair with index separation >=3; neighbors and
next-neighbors use bond/angle constraints instead.

For an interval [a,b], violation is max(a-value,0,value-b). Steric violation
is max(0,radius_i+radius_j-distance); handedness violation is
max(0,minimum_volume-sign*volume). Loss sums mean squared violations for the
five groups, weighted by public `loss_weights`:
bonds=4, angles=2, distances=1, sterics=4, chirality=2. Empty groups contribute
zero. Length residuals use angstrom numerical values, cosine and normalized
volume residuals are dimensionless; these empirical weights define the objective.
There is no hidden coordinate/RMSD term. Rigid rotation and translation preserve
loss within coordinate bounds. Reflections preserve distances but reverse handedness.
Collapsing or rescaling structures incurs independent bonded and steric losses.

The straight-line baseline places bead i at [3.8*(i-(N-1)/2),0,0]. It is a legal
artifact, not a physically valid conformation. Score is
`clip((q-q_baseline)/(1-q_baseline),0,1)`, where `q=1/(1+L/0.2)`. Zero public loss
defines perfect quality 1; the loss scale 0.2 resolves residual constraint errors.
Development mean is the search
score; larger held-out worlds and raw constraint losses are sealed diagnostics.
`valid` requires all four worlds valid. All worlds are repository-visible
procedural panels. NumPy/SciPy are available. `EVAL_TIMEOUT_S=300` in the task
entrypoint sets the candidate wall-clock deadline for all four worlds, including
held-out worlds, matching the default `sle eval --timeout 300`. The worker also
has the repository CPU resource limit; it is not a separate 300 seconds per world.
The outer wrapper allows an additional 120 seconds for trusted evaluation and cleanup.

[DGSOL's author page](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/~more/dgsol/) and Moré & Wu,
*Distance geometry optimization for protein structures* (1999), motivate the
problem. No DGSOL code or protein data is redistributed. Nearest tasks:
ProteinStabilityDesign produces sequences, GraphFromDistances produces graphs,
ForceFieldCalibration produces interaction parameters. Frontier-Engineering's
`diverse_conformer_portfolio` selects existing conformers whereas this task
constructs coordinates. The residual overlap risk is high; external review,
all-atom validation and frontier difficulty calibration remain pending.

Any invalid world makes the entire submission invalid: aggregate development and
held-out scores are zero. Per-world diagnostics are retained only in trusted reports.

Nearest task forms: LennardJonesCluster also optimizes molecular coordinates; this task instead scores public interval, angle, exclusion and chirality constraints. The latter three are task-specific extensions of distance geometry.
