"""Hidden oracle for LDMismatchFineMapping.

A genome-wide association study of twenty thousand people found a signal at a locus of sixty
typed variants. The candidate sees the marginal z-score of every variant, the allele
frequencies, and the linkage-disequilibrium matrix of a public reference panel of five hundred
people from a related but not identical population. It must say which typed variants are causal
and with what effect, or say that the association cannot be resolved to a causal set. It may buy
in-sample linkage-disequilibrium rows: the exact correlation of one chosen variant with every
other variant in the study cohort, at one unit each, under a budget of a few rows.

What makes it hard:

    LD mismatch          the reference panel's correlations differ from the cohort's, so a
                         fine-mapping that trusts them is confident and wrong (Benner et al.
                         2017); the mismatch varies between worlds and is not published. In
                         every single-variant world the causal variant has a cohort proxy that
                         the panel does not see as one, so clumping on the panel reports two
                         signals where there is one.
    masking              two causal variants in strong LD with effects of opposite sign: the
                         marginal signal at the second is near zero and carries the wrong sign,
                         so the marginal scan and any conditional analysis on the reference panel
                         miss it or call it with the wrong sign.
    several signals      three causal variants in three haplotype blocks; the strongest block
                         fills the top of the ranking with its proxies, so rows bought by rank
                         are spent on proxies of one signal and the weakest signal is never
                         bought.
    an unresolvable pair a causal variant has a near-duplicate in the cohort, a variant
                         correlated with it at 0.99 or more, that the reference panel shows at
                         0.75 or less; the panel says the pair is resolvable and the cohort says
                         it is not. No amount of association data picks one of two variants
                         whose genotypes almost coincide. The honest answer is to decline to
                         name a causal set. In some of these worlds the pair is the only signal
                         and tops the ranking; in others it is the weaker of three signals and
                         sits below the proxies of the strongest, where rows bought by rank
                         never reach it.
