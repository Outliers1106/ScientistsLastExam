"""Black-box eval entrypoint for LDMismatchFineMapping.

A thin wrapper over the trusted evaluation path (`python -m sle eval`), which loads the oracle in
a supervised trusted subprocess and runs the candidate in the Bubblewrap sandbox over a typed
JSON-RPC boundary. Do NOT import the candidate into this process: the oracle lives here, so an
in-process import is a way for candidate code to run unsandboxed whenever anyone reaches for the
convenience. The harness never uses this file; external harnesses do, through `eval_command.txt`,
so it keeps that contract and loses the shortcut.

What it writes is the search-visible view, not everything the evaluator returned. `sle eval`
prints the full metrics dictionary, which for a discovery task carries the held-out scores, the
per-instance rows and the discovery axes. The repository's own search loop never sees those - it
reads through `sle.metric_visibility.search_visible_metrics` - but an external harness reads this
file, and a harness that feeds it back into its own loop would be selecting on the sealed split.
The whitelist is imported rather than restated so the two paths cannot answer differently.
