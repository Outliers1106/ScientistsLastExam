# IsotopeFluxIdentifiability: scoring evidence — 2026-09-06

## Scientific endpoints

Zero is the all-refusal scientific floor; perfect supported identifiable fluxes
plus correct zero-net refusal defines one. The mean error over net and total
exchange flux, divided componentwise by max(truth,0.1), now has a zero-credit
tolerance of 0.025 instead of 0.6. The observation budget and three-start weighted
least-squares reference are unchanged. Individual parallel exchange branches
remain unidentifiable and are never accepted. The stricter tolerance was chosen
with reference measurements; shifted held-out measurements are reported
separately and do not constitute blind frontier validation.

## Reproduction and measurements

The legal `solution.py` baseline scores **0.000000**, valid=1. The input-only
comparison reference is `references/reference.py`.
Reproduce using:

```sh
python -m sle eval --allow-uncertified --task MetabolicEngineering/IsotopeFluxIdentifiability \
  --candidate benchmarks/Biology/IsotopeFluxIdentifiability/references/reference.py --timeout 300
```

Baseline and reference were validated through the Linux candidate sandbox on
implementation commit `3b62c02`; baseline score was exactly zero and both were valid.

| Solver | Development normalized score | heldout_scientific_score | Valid |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Original reference | 0.73709196 | 0.48395168 | 1 |

The discovery held-out column is raw scientific quality, not the normalized
development scale. Optimization held-out scores use the same normalization as
development. All reference algorithms are unchanged by this calibration.
Pre-calibration score measurements do not describe this revision.

## Limits and provenance

These original procedural worlds are repository-visible; held-out means excluded
from search feedback, not server-secret. No external datasets or code are
redistributed. Model simplifications and nearest-task overlap are in `Task.md`.
Precision/headroom measurements do not establish expert difficulty: strong
classical comparisons, frontier draws, long-horizon search and external domain
review remain pending. The task stays **candidate**.

## Admission review — 2026-09-08

Maintainer truth-start weighted-fit diagnostic reached about 0.78 versus reference 0.737; one held-out supported world still scored zero. Increasing reference nfev to 2000 did not improve score. Information budget and refusal worlds require redesign.

These findings are from the [maintainer review](https://github.com/Geniusyingmanji/ScientistsLastExam/pull/43) except the explicitly identified independent geometry reproduction. They supersede any earlier suggestion that a low reference score alone establishes useful headroom. Scientific instance/normalization revisions remain pending; passing software tests does not resolve these blockers. No frontier-model draws were performed in this follow-up.
